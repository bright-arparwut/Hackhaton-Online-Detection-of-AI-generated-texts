**Introduction**
Artificial Intelligence has become extremely proficient at generating human-like text. This raises a concern for the authenticity and veracity of digital content. To combat this, we developed a machine learning model that is capable of distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated text.

Our model uses the Simple Transformers library, a powerful wrapper for Transformers models, and is based on the pretrained DistilBERT model, which is a distilled version of BERT that maintains most of BERT's performance while being lighter and faster.
